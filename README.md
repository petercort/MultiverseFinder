# Multiverse Finder

Currently will take a list of cards. I've given a test file, cardlist.txt, with a few cards in it.  You can put as many cards in the list as you want to get links.

Running the program! 

From the command line: python multiverseFinder.py >> index.html

This will output as an HTML file that you can use and make use of the hotlinks! You could output to whatever type of file you want, but you'll get the full html output.
